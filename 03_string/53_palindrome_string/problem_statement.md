# Problem Statement: [Palindrome String](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindrome-string0817/1)

## Difficulty: Easy

---

### **Problem Description**

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome.  
A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:  
`s = "abba"`

**Output**:  
`true`

**Explanation**:  
"abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

---

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:  
`s = "abc"`

**Output**:  
`false`

**Explanation**:  
"abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.

---

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:  
`s = "a"`

**Output**:  
`true`

**Explanation**:  
A single-character string is always a palindrome.

---

#### **Example 4**

**Input**:  
`s = "acbca"`

**Output**:  
`true`

**Explanation**:  
"acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

---

### **Constraints**

- `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^6`
- The string `s` contains only lowercase letters (`a-z`).
