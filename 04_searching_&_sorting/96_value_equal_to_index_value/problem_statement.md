### **Problem Description**  

Given an array `arr`, your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value. (Consider 1-based indexing).

**Note**: There can be more than one element in the array which has the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. The array follows 1-based indexing.

### **Examples**  

#### **Example 1**  

**Input**:  
`arr[] = [15, 2, 45, 4, 7]`  

**Output**:  
`[2, 4]`  

**Explanation**:  
Here, `arr[2] = 2` exists, and `arr[4] = 4` exists here.

---

#### **Example 2**  

**Input**:  
`arr[] = [1]`  

**Output**:  
`[1]`  

**Explanation**:  
Here `arr[1] = 1` exists.

### **Constraints**  

- `1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^5`  
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6`
