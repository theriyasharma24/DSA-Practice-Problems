### Problem Description

Given three distinct numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, find the number with a value in the middle. The goal is to achieve this with the minimum number of comparisons.

---

### Examples

**Example 1**

**Input**:  
`a = 978, b = 518, c = 300`

**Output**:  
`518`

**Explanation**:  
Since `518` is greater than `300` and less than `978`, it is the middle element.

---

**Example 2**

**Input**:  
`a = 162, b = 934, c = 200`

**Output**:  
`200`

**Explanation**:  
Since `200` is greater than `162` and less than `934`, it is the middle element.

---

**Example 3**

**Input**:  
`a = 246, b = 214, c = 450`

**Output**:  
`246`

**Explanation**:  
Since `246` is greater than `214` and less than `450`, it is the middle element.

### Constraints

- `1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are distinct.
