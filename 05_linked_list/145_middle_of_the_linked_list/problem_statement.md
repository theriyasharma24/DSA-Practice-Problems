### **Problem Description**

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the **middle node** of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, **return the second middle node**.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:
`head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output**:
`[3, 4, 5]`

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:
`head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

**Output**:
`[4, 5, 6]`

**Explanation**:
The list has two middle nodes `3` and `4`. By the problemâ€™s requirement, we return the second one (`4`).
