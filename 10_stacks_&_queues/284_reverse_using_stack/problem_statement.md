# Problem Statement: [Reverse Using Stack ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-string-using-stack/1)

**Difficulty:** Easy  

---

## **Problem Description**  
You are given a string `S`, and the task is to reverse the string using a **stack**.

---

## **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
S = "GeeksforGeeks"
```
**Output:**  
```
skeeGrofskeeG
```

---

## **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
S = "Geek"
```
**Output:**  
```
keeG
```

---

## **Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **`reverse(S)`**, which takes the string `S` as an input parameter and **returns the reversed string**.

---

## **Expected Time Complexity:**  
- **O(N)** (where N is the length of the string)  

## **Expected Auxiliary Space:**  
- **O(N)** (for the stack storage)

---

## **Constraints:**  
- **1 ≤ length of the string ≤ 100**
