# Problem Statement: [Number of 1 Bits](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-bits0143/1)

**Difficulty:** Easy  

---

## **Problem Description**  
Given a positive integer `n`, your task is to return the **count of set bits (1s)** in its binary representation.

---

## **Examples**

### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
n = 6
```
**Output:**  
```
2
```
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 6 is `'110'`, which has **two** set bits.

---

### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
n = 8
```
**Output:**  
```
1
```
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 8 is `'1000'`, which has **one** set bit.

---

### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
n = 3
```
**Output:**  
```
2
```
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 3 is `'11'`, which has **two** set bits.

---

### **Constraints**
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹`
