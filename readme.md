# DSA Practice Problems

The aim of this repository is to contain optimized solutions solved in multiple programming languages for a large set of problems (450+) from [Love Babbar's DSA list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hOcdXqguI7MM3U2EEoHYExMLWnVl19SrMs3llFXjeqA/edit?usp=sharing). 

You can add your solutions or if you believe that your solution is **more optimized** than the existing one in the repository, feel free to open a **Pull Request (PR)** with your improved version.

## Overview

The problems are sourced from popular platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **HackerRank**, etc., and are sorted into categories such as:
- Arrays
- Matrix
- String
- Searching and Sorting
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees
- And more!

Each problem has:

- A **problem statement** (`problem_statement.md`)
- A solution in multiple languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Optional **test cases** for validating the solution

## Start Contributing

We encourage contributions from everyone! Here's how you can get involved:
- Create an issue
- **Fork** this repository
- **Clone** it to your local machine
- Choose a problem or category
- **Add or update a solution** in your preferred language
- At the bottom of your solution file, please add **Time and Space Complexities** of your code in form of comments.
- **Commit** your changes and **push** them to your fork
- **Create a Pull Request (PR)** with a description of the changes and screenshot of passed test cases on any platform.
- **Link the issue with the PR** to close it when PR gets merged. 

If you want to help improve the repository or have suggestions for new features, feel free to open an issue!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by categories and subfolders for each problem. Here's an example structure:

```
- 01 Array
  - 01 reverse_the_array
    - problem_statement.md   # Problem description
    - python
      - 01 reverse_the_array.py     # Python solution
    - java
      - 01 reverse_the_array.java    # Java solution
    - cpp
      - 01 reverse_the_array.cpp    # C++ solution
```

- Each category folder contains problems.
- Inside each problem folder:
  - `problem_statement.md` contains the problem description.
  - Language-specific folders (e.g., `python`, `java`, `cpp`) contain the respective solutions.
  - Optionally, there might be test files for validating solutions.

## Supported Languages

We encourage contributors to add solutions in any language of their choice! 

## How to Add Your Solution

To add a new solution:

1. Navigate to the appropriate category folder (e.g., `01 Array`).
2. Create a new folder for the problem (e.g., `01 reverse_the_array`).
3. Add the following:
   - **problem_statement.md**: The problem description (you can use the template provided).
   - **Solution file(s)**: Add your solution in the language of your choice with time and space complexities in comments.
5. Once you're done, commit your changes and create a pull request.

## Test Your Solutions

We recommend that you test your solution thoroughly before submitting it. If your solution passes **all the test cases on the respective platform** (e.g., LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks), you can proceed with submitting it.
